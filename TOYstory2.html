            Samantha is a 71-year-old retired woman who lives alone. She recently moved to a new city, and has no family or friends nearby. To pass the time, she often plays the piano, which she’s been playing ever since she was a child. Though she enjoyed the new area she was in, she quickly began feeling lonely and isolated.

            One day, while getting groceries, she noticed a flyer advertising a nearby TOY station that was looking for elderly volunteers. Intrigued, she contacted the volunteers at the station and signed up to participate.

            The first child she was asked to watch was a 7-year-old girl named Emma. Emma has an interest in music, but because of her families current socioeconomic status, they haven’t been able to afford lessons for her.

        <p>
            When the three entered the TOY station, a volunteer checked Emma in and introduced her to Samantha, who was sitting at a keyboard she had brought with her. After introducing themselves, Samantha spent the rest of her time with Emma teaching her the basics of music, musical notation, and how to play the piano.

            When Emmas parents returned, they were astonished at how much Emma had learned. After this, they continued to drop Emma off at the station once every week so she could continue receiving lessons from Samantha.

            With the help of TOY, Samantha was able to find someone who made her feel a little less alone in a new place, and Emma was able to receive music lessons that she otherwise wouldn't be able to get.
